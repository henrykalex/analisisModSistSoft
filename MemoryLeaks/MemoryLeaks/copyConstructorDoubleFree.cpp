/*

    INVALID FREES
    
    Destructor of Child is called twince (for a and b instances), but
    as default copy constructor is used, no new instance of p is creeated
    thus no delete is needed

    Solution: 
    in destructor ask wheter the pointer is allocated, then free
    
    I performed it usig mcheck and mprobe, but those libraries are good onl for debugging
    purposes.

    //put the following function before main
    
        void no_op(enum mcheck_status status) {}

    // in main, the first line must be
        
        mcheck(&no_op);
        
    // in destructor of child
    
        ~Child()
        {
            if(mprobe(p) != MCHECK_FREE)
            {
                delete p;
                p = NULL;
            }
        }
    
    Listoooo
    
    The right wai to do it is implementing copi constructor with deep copi then there are 2 instances of p and no double
    free is performed
